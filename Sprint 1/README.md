# Equanimity Development Branch
This branch is a running merge of the `backend` and `Frontend` branches. A running merge means that every time you open the project, it is up-to-date with all commits to both the `backend` and `Frontend` branches.

## Setup
### Running Merge
To acheive the running merge property, **run either the `merge.sh` (macOS) or `merge.bat` (Windows) script *every time* you open the project on this branch**. This will ensure that all commits from the `backend` and `Frontend` branches are brought to your clone of the repository and put in this branch each time you open it.

### Backend
Did you read the Running Merge section above? GO READ IT! Then, see the README.md file in the `backend` folder.

### Frontend
Read the Running Merge section one more time. Like actually read it. Then, see the README.md file in the `frontend` folder.

## Running the Project
### Backend
To run the backend, open the integrated VSCode terminal and navigate to the `Sprint 1/backend` folder (see README.md in the backend folder for guidance). Then, run `npm run dev` in the terminal.

### Frontend
To run the frontend, make a new terminal in VSCode by clicking the plus button in the top right corner of the terminal, or by clicking `Terminal > New Terminal` in the application menus at the very top of your screen. Then, navigate to the `Sprint 1/frontend` folder (see README.md in the frontend folder for guidance). Finally, run `npm run start` in the terminal.
